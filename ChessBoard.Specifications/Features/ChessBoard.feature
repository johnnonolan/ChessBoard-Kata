Feature: Boundaries of the board.
In order to obey the rules of Chess
As a player
I want to be prevented from entering moves outside the boundary of the board.

Scenario: Pawn at top.
Given I have a White Pawn at A8 
And I have a Black Knight at A1
When I move the Pawn to A9
Then I should be warned of an illegal move message

Scenario: Knight heads off board
Given I have a Black Knight at G8
And I have a White Pawn at A1
And I move the Pawn to A2
When I move the Knight to I7
Then I should be warned of an illegal move message
